# whis-data

This repository no longer contains the automatically updating WHOIS data; it is directly published to NPM every month. The JSON file can be downloaded directly from, for example, [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/whis-data@1.2.x/whois-servers.json). The data is updated automatically with [whis-bot](https://github.com/jolle/whis-bot).

Please report any issues with the data in [issues](https://github.com/jolle/whis-data/issues/new).
